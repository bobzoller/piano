h2. What is it?

Piano is a simple Sinatra app that displays your iTunes download data. It doesn't do much yet (really it does nothing to improve anything :), but advanced reporting will eventually be available. Maybe you want to help?

h2. How does it work?

Apple hates you. Why else would they give you such terrible sales statistics? Number of downloads? Yeah, that really helps a ton. They don't even respect you enough to give you a total for your daily sales.

Piano gets your daily stats for your iPhone applications and stores them in a local sqlite database. Now we can interact with the data like you wish you could on Apple's site.

h2. Getting started

h3. Dependencies

h4. Gems

* Sinatra
* Mechanize

* sqlite3-ruby

h4. Other stuff

* sqlite

h3. You can do it!

Create the database
<code>rake db:migrate</code>

Get today's reports
<code>ruby lib/get_reports.rb</code>

Start application
<code>ruby piano.rb</code>

Voila. There's all your reports.

Set up a cron for get_reports.rb so it automatically fetches your reports every day.

h2. What's next?

Piano doesn't do much yet. But its just getting started. Soon it will:

* Dashboard showing total downloads
* View reports by product or country
* Sweet awesome graphs
* authentication even
